# Securing Machine Learning Model Deployment with AWS

## Introduction
Our senior design project goal was to deploy a machine learning model and ensure its security
against potential attack vectors. With the increasing adoption of machine learning, it is
crucial to be able to understand how to secure ML models.
This documentation provides a solution with all the steps to securing the endpoint of our deployed model.

## Goal
- Deploy a machine learning model on a cloud platform.
- Implement robust security measures to protect the model's endpoint.

## Background
- We decided to utilize AWS services since we collaborated with Capital One and
Capital One mostly uses AWS for their applications.
- We decided to chose
Amazon SageMaker for training and deploying our model.
